- Blacklist a set amount of random items
- -1 for no limit
- PoolSizeVariance: Adjusts Pool size every run randomly by a maximum of this number. eg. numWhites = 20, PoolSizeVariance = 5 -> Size between 15 and 25
- forceCategories: Forces Category ratio to be the same as basegame every time, ensures there will always be at least one item of each category available
